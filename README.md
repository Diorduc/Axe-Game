# Axe Game

A simple game where you control a circle to avoid colliding with a moving axe.

## Description

Axe Game is a basic 2D game developed using the Raylib library. The objective of the game is to control a circle using the arrow keys and avoid colliding with a moving axe. The axe moves up and down the screen, and the player can move the circle left, right, up, and down to avoid the axe. If the circle collides with the axe, the game is over, and the player can restart the game by pressing the 'R' key.

1. Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to move the circle left and right.
2. Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the circle up and down.
3. Avoid colliding with the moving axe to stay in the game.
4. If you collide with the axe, the game is over.
5. To restart the game, press the 'R' key after a game over.
